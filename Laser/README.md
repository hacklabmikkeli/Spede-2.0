Laser file is for the top panel so the buttons and screen will settle correctly.

Things to develope further:
  - Include some engraved graphics to the panel.
  - Include holes for the buttons so they wont spin even if loose.
  - 2 layer style where you sandwich printed graphics between 2 sheets? wood and acryl?
